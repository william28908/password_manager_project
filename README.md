# Password Generator & Manager Project
## Description
  Welcome to my first Python project! This is a simple Python script that allows users to not only create and store their passwords, but also update, delete, and view the current records that are in a SQL database. In addition, users can do those same actions to any username or website name they also inputted. 
  The way the script works is that 


Users can add, update, and delete the passwords they have entered which are saved in a SQL database. On the database, the passwords are encrypted which means users have to run the program, specifically the "(v)iew" option, to see their actual passwords, not the encrypted ones. To see how the program worked along with the input from the user, the file can be downloaded and ran in VSCode
